This repo contains the codes for different sorting/pathfinding algorithms that are visualized using python or p5.js.

The motivation for this porject came from a youtube video named "15 Sorting algorithms in 6 minutes"

I suggest watching this video to experience the beauty of different sorting algorithms.
